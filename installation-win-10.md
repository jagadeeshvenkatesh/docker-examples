# Docker for windows 10
- there are two docker tool chain present, one with docker desktop, another with docker tool box. I prefer lightweight docker only(not kubernaties) setup, so docker tool box is the best. 

# Download & install Docker toolbox
- Download latest release from here https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases
- My latest tested release https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v19.03.1/DockerToolbox-19.03.1.exe

# Notes : 
1. its better you dont have visualVM not installed before. Docker toolbox will install it. 
2. If you have windows 10 home, docker toolbox is only option.
